# Dora Virus
What is it? Dora Virus, is a program that infects all images inside a directory and adds a image on dora on top of it. This is a fun little project that will let me learn better about math and recursion.

## Will this harm all my photos?
The program will let you choose which directory you want to infect, if you do so the images in the directory cannot be repaired / recovered. So please try this with images that dont matter, or have have copies of the images. I am not responsible for any damage to files.

## Installation and Running Dora Virus
```bash
git clone https://github.com/baplou/dora-virus.git
cd dora-virus
./dora.py
```
